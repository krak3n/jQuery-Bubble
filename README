jQuery bubble is a jQuery plugin that allows you to traverse up the DOM tree much like jQuery's
$.find() method which traverses down the DOM tree.

Usage
=====

1. Include jquery and bubble in your HTML document.
2. You can then use the following syntax: var element = $('.element').bubble('.element_higher_up_the_tree');

Example
=======

HTML:

<form method="post" action="some/url/">
	<label for="id_name">Name:</label>
	<input type="textfield" id="id_name" name="id_name" />
	<a href="#" class="custom-button">Submit form</a>
</form>

Javascript:

$(document).ready(function() {
	$('.custom-button').bind('click', function() {
		$(this).bubble('form').submit();
	});
})
